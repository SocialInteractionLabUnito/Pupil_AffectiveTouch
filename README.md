Data and codes for replicating statistics and plots of "Affective Touch is encoded by pupil dilation as a comprehensive social phenomenon".

All codes work with provided data. Just run them.
Data and codes must be placed in the same folder.

Only "plot_pupil_timecourse.m" script does not work here, as the related dataset is too large to be uploaded. 
To request the associated dataset, feel free to contact Professor Olga Dal Monte (olga.dalmonte@unito.it)
